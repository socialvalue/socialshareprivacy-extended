# SocialSharePrivacy Extended
A copy of the extended social share privacy plugin (http://www.illusions-schmiede.com/Socialshareprivacy-XL)

## Why the copy?
The plugin had a bug. Now it's fixed and accessible to everyone.

**Update, version 1.2.1:**
In addition to the bug fix the plugin now includes an option to use the HTML5 version of the Facebook Like button. This allows users to add an individual text to the timeline posting which is created by the Like button. A Facebook app ID is required to use this option. For details see socialshareprivacy-xl-readme.txt.

## Where can I find the basic plugin?
